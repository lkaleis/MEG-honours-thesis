Ttle: Time-Resolved Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) in the Brain's Resting-State 
Network using Magnetoencephalography (MEG)


ABSTRACT

The resting state networks (RSNs) in the brain can be investigated non-invasively
using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The underlying network connectivity is
revealed through cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in which the
amplitude of high-frequency oscillations is coupled to and modulated by the phase
of slower oscillatory activity. In the present work, a new measure for assessing PAC
in a time-resolved manner is explored to better capture the dynamic fluctuation of
coupling intensity. The measure is applied to resting-state recordings in healthy
subjects from the open MEG archive (OMEGA). The preliminary findings presented
here draw insight to the technical aspects of this technique and offer future
direction for examining long-range communication in the brain, specifically in RSNs.
